\section*{Introduction}

This chapter is dedicated to evaluating the performance of our proposed Collaborative Highway Surveillance (CHS) system for real-time detection of speeding violations. It begins with a presentation of the evaluation metrics used to assess detection accuracy, communication reliability, coverage rate, and energy efficiency—factors that are crucial for real-world deployment on UAV-based platforms.

We then detail the experiments conducted to compare the effectiveness of the distributed drone selection algorithm, the communication protocol, and the machine learning prediction module. Multiple system configurations were tested under different operational scenarios, including real-time hotspot detection, predictive deployment, and mixed reactive–predictive strategies. Their performance was analyzed using metrics such as average detection latency, prediction accuracy, coverage ratio, and network lifetime.

The results presented in this chapter provide insight into the trade-offs between system complexity, operational performance, and deployment feasibility, validating the benefits of combining real-time sensor data with predictive analytics in creating an adaptive and efficient highway monitoring solution.
