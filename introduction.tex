\section{Context and Motivation}

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operate in dynamic environments where they may encounter obstacles during various missions. Current technologies often struggle to fully address these challenges, highlighting the need for increased autonomy in UAV systems.

Autonomy plays a crucial role in applications such as inspection, path planning, communication, delivery systems, and task scheduling [72]. According to [73], UAV autonomy is classified into ten levels, which define control capabilities and serve as a metric for autonomy implementation, as illustrated in Fig. 21.
